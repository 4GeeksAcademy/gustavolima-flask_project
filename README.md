# Flask App with Machine Learning

This project seeks to explore the possibilities with Flask to build web based apps tied to a Machine Learning algorithm.

## ðŸ“’ Key Takes

Flask is a nice method to create web apps, but do require you have knowledge of HTML / CSS to design something appealing. The implementation of Flask with the ML algorithm is quite easy, but if you're not at ease with HTML / CSS, it will be a bit harder. I do prefer to use other options to create web apps / interfaces for ML Algorithm to be used. 
None the less, Flask allows for more customization compared to other solutions.
